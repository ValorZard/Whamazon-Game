# Whamazon-Game
A game for Hot Jam 2021

Game Assets are also licensed under MIT

The theme for this game was "Boiling Point"



This game was made for LCAD's 2021 Hot Jam. It is an absurdist racing game lending light commentary on the harsh demand we and the company put on amazon workers.



Controls are: 

​	WASD to move

​	mouse to aim where to drive

​	shift to drift



Rules:

Reach the end without completely damaging the package, while deliver in a record time. 

The lower the score, the better you've done.

When you collide with a pedestrian or car, your boiling point, or your temper rises and you drive faster, which can get you the the end quicker, but it also makes you drive more erratic.
